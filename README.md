# Ledgerly App

This is a Flutter application implementation of the Ledgerly designs.

## Setup

Since the project structure was created manually, you may need to initialize the platform-specific files.

1. Create the platform folders:
   ```bash
   cd ledgerly_app
   flutter create .
   ```

2. Get dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Features

- **Dashboard Screen**: Shows financial overview, summary cards, and list of parties.
- **Party Ledger Screen**: Shows detailed transaction history for a specific party (e.g., Acme Corp).
- **Theme**: Custom theme matching the design with Inter font and specific color palette.
- **Navigation**: Working navigation between Dashboard and Party Ledger screens.

## Note

Ensure you have Flutter installed and configured in your environment.
